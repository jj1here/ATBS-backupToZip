# ATBS backupToZip
---

This program copies a folder in the current path and then converts it into a .zip file to make a backup

The book and program are starting to become a lot more practical with this program it copies the folder and everything in it and cmakes it into a .zip and names it and if there is another .zip with the same name it makes it a plus one.
